# intro-to-git-lab
This repository is for the version control lab assignment.

## Project Overview
This repository is used for the CSP 451 lab on basic Git and GitHub workflows.  
You will practise cloning, branching, making pull requests, and writing Markdown documentation.

## Key Concepts
- **Version Control** lets us track changes, collaborate, and roll back mistakes.  
- **Git** offers a staging area, lightweight branches, local speed, and strong data integrity.  
- **GitHub** adds cloud backup, pull-request code reviews, and an issue tracker.

## How to Run This Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jli638/intro-to-git-lab.git
cd intro-to-git-lab
cat version-control-basics.md   # read the file you added
