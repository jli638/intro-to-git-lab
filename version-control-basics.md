# Version Control – Quick Facts

## Definition
Version control is a toolset that records changes to files over time so we can recall specific versions later.

## Key Git Features
- **Distributed** – every clone is a full backup of the repo.  
- **Staging area** – choose exactly what to commit.  
- **Cheap branches** – create, switch, and merge branches in seconds.  
- **Fast performance** – local operations need no network.  
- **Strong integrity** – every commit is protected by a SHA-1 / SHA-256 hash.
